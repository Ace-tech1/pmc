                            <p>Receiving abnormal Pap smear results can be unsettling, but it’s important to understand that this doesn't always mean cancer. A Pap test is a screening tool that detects changes in cervical cells, often caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). In many cases, these abnormalities are mild and resolve on their own. Your healthcare provider will recommend the next steps, which may include a repeat Pap test, an HPV test, or a procedure like colposcopy for closer examination. Early detection allows for early intervention, giving you the best chance at staying healthy. At PMC Medical Center, we’re here to guide you through each step with compassion, clarity, and expert care.
