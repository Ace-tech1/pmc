                        <p>Men’s health deserves focused attention at every stage of life — from youth through senior years. Yet, many men delay routine checkups, putting their long-term wellness at risk. At PMC, we emphasize proactive health screenings, mental health awareness, heart health, prostate exams, and overall wellness tailored to each decade. In your 20s and 30s, we focus on lifestyle, fitness, and preventative care. In your 40s and beyond, screenings become vital for early detection of conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, and cancers. Our goal is to support men in building healthier, longer lives — because prevention is always better than cure.</p>
