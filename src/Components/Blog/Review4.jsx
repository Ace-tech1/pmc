                            <p>Every October, we unite to raise awareness, offer support, and educate our community about breast cancer. Early detection saves lives — and routine screenings like mammograms play a crucial role. At PMC, we’re proud to offer state-of-the-art imaging, diagnostic support, and a team of compassionate professionals dedicated to women’s health. Beyond pink ribbons, Breast Cancer Awareness Month is about empowerment, strength, and solidarity. We honor survivors, remember loved ones, and commit to advancing research and care. Let’s continue spreading awareness and encouraging every woman to prioritize her health.
